# Summary

Orthogonal arrays, optimal designs and conference designs are important tools in the design of
experiments [@Hedayat1999]. The Orthogonal Array
package contains functionality to generate and analyse these various designs. bla bla bla

For generation of orthogona arrays and conference designs we use a exhaustive generation of designs with ismorphism pruning
[@Eendebak2009], [@TwoLevelEnumeration].  bla bla
A generic interface to Nauty [@nauty] is provied to perform ismophism testing and reduction to normal form for designs with a specified isomorphism group.
A large collection of arrays can be found on the Orthogonal Array
packagewebsite :cite:`EendebakOA` or on the website of Neil
Sloane :cite:`Sloanewebsite`. The optima designs are generated using a flexible optimality criterium and
a xxx optimization algorithm [@Doptimal].


Once design have been generated, various statistical properties of the designs can be calculated. These include
generalized wordlength patterns, J-characteristics and the ranks of various matrices.

The package consists of a C++ library with an easy Python interface generated by SWIG.
Examples for both generation and analysis of designs are available on the documentation.
