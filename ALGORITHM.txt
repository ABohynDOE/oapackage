j4 method

- oaindex trick: perform sorting in blocks of index
- column check: performed in steps, quit as soon as LMC_LESS or LMC_MORE is detected
- root trick: use pre-calculated root permutations
- permutation trick: do not change the array at all, only keep track of row, column and level permutations
- tplus method: no sorting and comparision for rows after oaindex, for tplusplus we can stop sorting after 2*lambda
- sorting: use a sort the aborts if no changes are made, use a special sort for binary values
- flipsort

- tplus init: no rowsort copy needed...

even-odd arrays
